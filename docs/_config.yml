# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

  Open-NARS is the open source version of the <a style="color: #fff" href="https://cis.temple.edu/~pwang/NARS-Intro.html">NARS</a> project, a general-purpose AI system, designed in the framework of a reasoning system, which attempts to uniformly explain and reproduce many cognitive facilities, including reasoning, learning, planning, etc., so as to provide a unified theory, model, and system for AI as a whole. The ultimate goal of this research is to build a thinking machine.
