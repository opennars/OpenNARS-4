**Question derivation.** A question Q and a judgment J produce a derived question Q', if and only if the answer to Q', call it J', can be used with J to derive an answer to Q by a two-premise inference rule; a question Q by itself produces a derived question Q', if and only if the answer to Q', call it J', can be used to derive an answer to Q by a one-premise inference rule.
