class Buffer(Bag):
    '''
    According to *the Conceptual Design of OpenNARS 3.1.0*:
        A buffer is a time-restricted bag containing new (input or derived) tasks.
        A buffer has the following major routines:
        **put**: As defined in bag.
        **take**: As defined in bag, except that if the selected task is already expired,
        the selection will repeat up to a predetermined times. Also, in buffer this
        operation is not directly invoked from the outside, but from insider, as
        part of observe.
        **observe**: If the buffer does not carry out temporal composition, this routine
        just call take to get a task, and return it. Otherwise it also uses the selected
        task and every other tasks to form tasks containing compounds events.
        The new tasks are put into the buffers. Given their high complexity,
        most of them will be removed. The remaining ones usually correspond to
        existing concepts in the memory or tasks in the buffer.

        This buffer holds first-order events, sorted by time.
        The purpose of this buffer is to generate temporal implication statements, e.g., (A &/ B =/> C)
        and compound events, e.g., (A &/ B).

        The operation for generating temporal statements is exhaustive. That means, for generating 3-component
        implication statements like (A &/ B =/> C), the algorithm scales O(n^3) for n elements

        The oldest events are at the lowest index, the newest events are at the highest index.
        The larger the event's timestamp, the newer it is.
